# fifa_project
In the FIFA 21 Project we will try to predict a player's "Overall Rating" by analysing data from the following dataset: fifa21_train.csv
It is s time to train a linear model and save it. 
In addition you will need to create functions to make predictions with your group model and to evaluate the modelâ€™s results on your group jupyter notebook.

Later, the LT will pick your group jupyter notebook, it will load another dataset and it will apply/call your functions to clean the dataset, make predictions with your model and then evaluate your group model into the new unseen data.
